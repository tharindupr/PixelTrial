	  Anuradhapura was the greatest monastic city of the ancient world and the heart of Sri Lankan civilisation for over a millennium.

	  At its height it was home to tens of thousands of monks at dozens of monasteries and served by a lay population which records suggest could have numbered nearly two million. 
	  Its flourishing Buddhist culture and architectural achievements made it famous across Asia and as far afield as Europe, while even today the sheer scale of its surviving ruins and stupas is breathtaking.

      <p>

	  Nuwara Eliya is often referred to by the Sri Lankan tourist industry as ‘Little England’. While most British visitors struggle to recognise modern England in Nuwara Eliya, the toy-town ambience does have a rose-tinted English country village feel to it, though it comes with a disorienting surrealist edge. Three-wheelers whiz past red telephone boxes. Water buffalo daubed in iridescent dye for the Tamil Thai Pongal festival mingle outside a pink, brick Victorian post office. A well-tended golf course morphs seamlessly into a rolling carpet of tea plantations. The dusty and bustling centre of town is a thoroughly Sri Lankan tangle, but scratch the surface a little to reveal colonial bungalows, well-tended hedgerows and pretty rose gardens.

  <div style="display: none;" id="dialog4" class="window"> <h2>Polonnaruwa</h2>
    <div id="lorem">
	  <center>
      <p>
	  Kings ruled the central plains of Sri Lanka from Polonnaruwa 800 years ago, when it was a thriving commercial and religious centre. From here, free-marketeers haggled for rare goods and the pious prayed at any one of its numerous temples. The glories of that age can be found in archaeological treasures which give a pretty good idea of how the city looked in its heyday. You'll find the archaeological park a delight to explore, with hundreds of ancient structures – tombs and temples, statues and stupas – in a compact core. The Quadrangle alone is worth the trip.
That Polonnaruwa is close to elephant-packed national parks only adds to its popularity. And the town itself makes a pleasant base for a day or two, fringed by a huge, beautiful tank with a relaxed ambience.
